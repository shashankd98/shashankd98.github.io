								<b>Deprojection and Dynamical Modelling of Barred Galacies</b><br>
								I am currently working with Prof. Monica Valluri on developing a method to construct the 3D density distribution 
								of barred galaxies. The goal of the project is to use the deprojected densities to dynamically model barred galaxies
								using Schwarzschild's method and calculate the masses of central supermassive black holes. 
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Semi-Cosmological Simulations of Baryonic Gas is Growing Dark Matter Halos</b><br>
								This was my Master's thesis with Prof. Prateek Sharma. Using hydrodynamic simulations, I studied the evolution of baryonic gas in 
								cosmologically growing dark matter halos. My model incoorporates various aspects of baryonic physics, such as radiative cooling
								and AGN jet feedback, in a cosmologically ivolving background. I study the evolution of the halo gas and growth of supermassive
								black holes under different radiative conditions. <br>

							<p>
								<b>Stellar Capture Rates in Galactic Nuclei Containing a Binary Black Hole</b> <br>
								This was my Bachelor's thesis with Prof. Arun Mangalam. I analyzed the orbital dynamics of field stars around supermassive binary black holes
								to develop a model for the flux into the loss cone of the primary black hole as a function of time. I made predictions for the tidal disruption 
								event detection rates and the fraction of them originating in binary black holes. <br>
								Link to <a href="/images/Shashank_BS_thesis.pdf">thesis</a>.

							<p>
								<b>Turbulent Power Spectrum of the Interstellar Medium</b><br>
								I wrote a code from scratch in Python to analyze the turbulent power spectrum of the various phases of the interstellar medium. Using data from the LAB 
								survey. I also calculated the solenoidal fraction in the velocity field of the Orion B molecular cloud using data from the IRAM-30m telescope. <br>

							<p>
								<b>Computational Modelling of Scattering of Electromagnetic Waves by Nanoparticles</b><br>
								I used the software Discrete Dipole Scattering (DDSCAT) to investigate the wavelength dependence of the dielectric function and scattering cross sections
								of nanoparticles of different compositions and sizes. I usedMie theory to obtain the corresponding theoretical results, and analyzed the discrepancies between 
								the two. <br>

							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Thermodynamic Origins of Information Theory</b><br>
								I studied the physical and mathematical relationship between Shannon entropy and mutual information, and the thermodynamic quantities like Boltzmann entropy and 
								free energy. I investigated the physical nature of information by analyzing the Maxwell demon paradox, Szilard engine, and the black hole information paradox.<br>
								Link to <a href="/images/Shashank_Thermo_report.pdf">report</a>.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Orbital Dynamics in the Hierarchical Three-Body Problem</b><br>
								I studied the hierarchical three-body setup and used the secular approximation to obtain equations of motion for circulating and librating orbits. I analyzed the 
								stability of these orbits in the presence of a distant perturber.<br>
